# Shortest Path Finder

## Overview

This project calculates the shortest path between cities using Dijkstra's algorithm and Breadth-First Search (BFS). It reads city data from a file, performs pathfinding algorithms, and outputs the results to a file.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Computes the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- **File I/O**: Load city data from a file and save pathfinding results to a file.

## Files

- `main.c`: Main source code for the project.
- `cities.txt`: Input file containing city data and distances.
- `shortest_distance.txt`: Output file for the shortest path results.

## How to Use

1. **Load Cities**: Load city data from `cities.txt` using the provided option in the program.
2. **Enter Source and Destination**: Specify source and destination cities to find the shortest path.
3. **View Results**: Results are saved to `shortest_distance.txt`.
